# pyoneer
Python learning game

Aim of the game is something akin to [zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).

Steps are connected to branches. To see the working code at step X:
```
$ git checkout step_X
```

[Step 1](https://github.com/PiTiLeZarD/pyoneer/tree/step_1): Have a little guy walking on a 3x4 map, nothing fancy
[Step 2](https://github.com/PiTiLeZarD/pyoneer/tree/step_2): Here the cells in the map have walls, objects and you can win the game
