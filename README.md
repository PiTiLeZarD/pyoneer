# pyoneer
Python learning game

Aim of the game is something akin to [zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).

Steps are connected to branches. To see the working code at step X:
```
$ git checkout step_X
```

 - [Step 1](https://github.com/PiTiLeZarD/pyoneer/tree/step_1): Have a little guy walking on a 3x4 map, nothing fancy ([Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiTiLeZarD/pyoneer/step_1/example.png))
 - [Step 2](https://github.com/PiTiLeZarD/pyoneer/tree/step_2): Here the cells in the map have walls, objects and you can win the game ([Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiTiLeZarD/pyoneer/step_2/example.png))
 - Step 3: Here we'll add some unit-tests, documentation, pep8, all the project goodies
 - Step 4: Here we'll have the concept of actions (go, pick, drop, attack, etc...), player's life, player's bag, useful objects (weapons, food, armour), monsters...
 - Step 5: Here we'll add customisable auto generated maps, yup that's it, it'll be heaps! 
 - Step 6: Here we'll add the concept of difficulty, levels, stregth of monsters, lasting effects (heal/poison)
 - Step 7: Let's make it look nice and web based, using docker/docker-compose
